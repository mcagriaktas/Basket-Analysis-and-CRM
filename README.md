# Basket-Analysis-and-CRM
Data Mininig Project (CRM)

I made this project for my Data Mining Lesson at Pamukkale University Faculty of Engineering, in the Industrial Engineering department.

My goal was to prepare the dataset for analysis and obtain output for basket analysis. However, I encountered difficulties in grouping the products due to the large size of the dataset and the abundance of details. As a result, I shifted my focus to CRM analysis (customer relationship management) and proceeded with customer ranking.

In this project, you will first see how I used pandas to read the dataset, followed by the cleaning of some values. If you read the 'About Dataset' section, you can find more details about it. In the main.py file, you will find my implementation of basic basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm. The provided codes primarily calculate values such as confidence and support. Finally, there is a section dedicated to CRM. I have included a source on CRM analysis that you should read if you are interested in CRM.

PS: I am currently working on product grouping. Once I finish the analysis, I will update the codes in mainv2.py!

Thank you
