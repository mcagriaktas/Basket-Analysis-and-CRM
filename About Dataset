When examining the Invoice column in the dataset, we can see what a person has purchased with their invoice ID. Therefore, the number of unique invoices corresponds to the 
number of customers. For example, in my initial reading, I misunderstood this part. It turns out that a customer can have multiple invoices. In frequency calculations, for 
instance, if a customer has the product X in two invoices, we consider the occurrence of X as 1. We do this to preserve combinations since we are conducting an analysis based 
on customers. If we didn't do this, the result would be different.

After general readings, the null_values function is executed. Missing data is either filled or deleted. Customer ID, being unique and specific, cannot be filled, so those rows 
are deleted. As for the description, similar products' descriptions can be written, but for now, we are deleting them. Note: Depending on the situation, descriptions of similar
products can be written. This should be evaluated based on the analysis.

Next, when calculating revenue, there are returns in the invoices. These returns are indicated by 'C' in the 'Invoice' column, for example, 'C489449'. Since returns are 
represented as negative values in the price, when calculating revenue, if we subtract the negatives from the total positive revenue, it leads to an illogical expense. 
Therefore, all returns must be deleted in order to calculate the revenue accurately.

In the basket analysis, the invoices and descriptions are first grouped, and the quantities are calculated. Then, the descriptions are transformed into columns, with the 
invoice ID kept, and the value 1 is assigned to the products purchased in the invoice, while the value 0 is assigned to the products not purchased.

If we set the min_sup value as 0.1 in the frequent_itemsets variable, it returns 33 values. If we set it as 0.01, it returns 8174 values. Thus, reducing the min_support value 
is not very reliable. Because in 8152 rows, it is suggested that 3 products can be purchased together with a 1.5% ratio. Therefore, a 1.5% ratio is not accurate. 
(The manager would burst into laughter if they saw this :D)

Accidentally or not, when examining all the products for France, there is a product called POSTAGE that is also being purchased. It becomes apparent that we are excluding 
online purchased products as well. However, this contradicts the purpose of analyzing the products. Therefore, we calculate the SUPPORT and CONFIDENCE without considering 
the POSTAGE lines. This process can actually lead to interesting analyses, but I am not examining it in detail at the moment.

We also subject the dataset to outlier analysis. During the cleaning process, strange values around 850 pounds keep appearing. We determine these outliers using probability 
statistics and two functions, and then clean them up.
